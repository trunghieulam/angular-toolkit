# Angular Toolkit

Angular Toolkit created by THLab, there is a boilerplate for beginning with:
- Multi-language (ngx-translate)
- Lazy-loading modules.
- Toast Service.
- Service Worker (PWA on https).
- Common SEO meta tags.
- Master layout with regular routing.

Hope it can help you to build the amazing applications.
